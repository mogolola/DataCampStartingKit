# RAMP starting kit on American Crop Yield Prediction

Authors: Mo YANG, Shuopeng WANG, Zizhao LI & Qixiang PENG

 Agricultural monitoring, in particular in developing countries, can help prevent famine and support humanitarian efforts. A central challenge is yield estimation, which is to pre- dict crop yields before harvesting. 
 
 Remote sensing, on the other hand, is a globally available and economical data source that has recently garnered much interest. 
 
 These multi-spectral remote sensing images, which include additional information besides the traditional visible wavelengths (RGB) and have fairly high spatial and temporal resolution, contain a wealth of information on vegetation growth and thus on agricultural outcomes.
 
 
 The challenge in this RAMP is to design an algorithm to automatically predict crop yield based on remote sensing data.

#### Set up

Open a terminal and

1. install the `ramp-workflow` library (if not already done)
  ```
  $ pip install git+https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow.git
  ```
  
2. Follow the ramp-kits instructions from the [wiki](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow/wiki/Getting-started-with-a-ramp-kit)

#### Local notebook

Get started on this RAMP with the [dedicated notebook](starting_kit.ipynb).

#### Help
Go to the `ramp-workflow` [wiki](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow/wiki) for more help on the [RAMP](http:www.ramp.studio) ecosystem.
